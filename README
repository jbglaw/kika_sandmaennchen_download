This small script will download the daily episode of "Unser Sandmann",
a famous show for young childreen just before going to bed.

Each day, a new episode will be broadcasted. It's available online starting
at around 18:50 o'clock (CET/CEST), but only for one day, until the next
episode is published.

	- wget
	- timeout
	- rtmpdump

Usage?
~~~~~~
Just invoke it. It'll try to download the episode currently available
online. It's placed into a file (in your current working directory)
and prefixed with the date of publication.
